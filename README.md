# EE3 Car

This is a basic Arduino Car, similar to https://www.amazon.com/wheel-layer-Chassis-Encoder-Arduino/dp/B06VTP8XBQ?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=AZ7YXD2PTX165. 

This uses Infrared LEDs and Receivers to detect a line, and uses a PID controller to track the line underneath the car.

Pretty basic stuff, nothing complicated here as this was working on a tiny arduino and on a breadboard (not a PCB).
